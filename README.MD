## Backend Server
A backend server that will start the session is needed for this sample,
luckily for you we already have a sample server for NodeJS, please reffer
to our documentation on subject: [Sample Backend Server](https://developer.incode.com/docs/code-samples-for-web-integrations#backend-sample-server)

You will need to expose this server to the internet using something like
